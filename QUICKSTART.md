# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with the PathRAG application quickly.

## Getting Started

### Login

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Use one of the default accounts to log in:
   - Username: `user1`, Password: `Pass@123`
   - Username: `user2`, Password: `Pass@123`

3. Alternatively, you can register a new account by clicking "Register" on the login page

### Dashboard

After logging in, you'll see the dashboard with an overview of:
- Total chat conversations
- Uploaded documents
- Knowledge graph statistics

## Using the Chat

1. Click on "Chats" in the sidebar
2. Type your question or message in the input field at the bottom
3. Press Enter or click the send button
4. The AI will respond based on the knowledge in the system
5. You can scroll through your chat history

### Chat Tips

- Ask specific questions for more accurate responses
- Reference documents you've uploaded for context-specific answers
- Try multi-hop questions that require connecting information across documents
- The AI uses the knowledge graph to provide more comprehensive responses

### Example Questions

Simple questions:
- "What are the main features of PathRAG?"
- "How does PathRAG compare to traditional RAG systems?"

Complex questions:
- "What techniques developed by researchers at Stanford have been applied to knowledge graph construction?"
- "How do the approaches used in PathRAG relate to earlier work on knowledge representation?"

## Working with Documents

1. Click on "Documents" in the sidebar
2. Click the "Upload Document" button
3. Drag and drop a file or click to select a file
   - Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, MD
4. The document will upload and be processed automatically
5. You'll see the upload progress in real-time
6. Once processed, the document will appear in the list

### Document Management Tips

- Larger documents may take longer to process
- The system extracts entities and relationships from documents to build the knowledge graph
- After uploading documents, you can ask questions about them in the chat
- Upload related documents to create a richer knowledge graph with more connections

## Exploring the Knowledge Graph

1. Click on "Knowledge Graph" in the sidebar
2. You'll see a visualization of the knowledge graph
   - Nodes represent entities (people, organizations, concepts, etc.)
   - Edges represent relationships between entities
3. You can:
   - Drag nodes to rearrange the graph
   - Zoom in/out using the mouse wheel
   - Hover over nodes to see details
4. Use the search box to query specific parts of the knowledge graph

### Knowledge Graph Tips

- Different colors represent different entity types
- The thickness of connections indicates the strength of relationships
- Try specific queries to focus on particular areas of knowledge
